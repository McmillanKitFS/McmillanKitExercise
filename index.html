            <b><i>Nier: Automata</i></b
            >, which shares the post-apocalyptic setting of Nier, takes place
            thousands of years after the original game's events.[12][13] The
            Nier fictional universe exists in an alternative timeline within the
            Drakengard series.[12] While carrying over the Drakengard tradition
            of a dark atmosphere and branching storylines, there is no direct
            narrative connection between Nier: Automata and the rest of the
            series.[12][14][15] The story is set in 11945 AD, and revolves
            around a proxy war between the human-made androids and an invading
            army of alien-made Machines.[16][17] Though they are prohibited from
            having emotions and lack true names, each android has a distinct
            personality.[16][17][18] The "YoRHa" android forces are commanded
            from the Bunker, a reconnaissance base that orbits Earth. Fending
            off the Machines, the YoRHa forces fight alongside pre-YoRHa Earth
            androids known as the Resistance.[19]

            <i><b>Nier: Automata</b></i> is set during a proxy war between
            alien-created Machines and human-crafted androids, focusing on the
            actions of combat android 2B, scanner android 9S, and rogue
            prototype A2. The story requires multiple playthroughs, with each
            playthrough revealing new story elements. The gameplay combines
            role-playing elements with action-based hack-and-slash combat. It
            also includes gameplay from other video game genres, with elements

          <h3>Battle System</h3>
          <p>
            Combat uses a real-time action-based hack and slash system, using
            both light and heavy attacks and combining them into different
            combination attacks. The player can also evade incoming attacks,
            gaining invulnerability or counterattack bonuses based on timing.
            The player is assisted by a flying "Pod" robot which launches
            customizable ranged attacks varying from simple gunfire to
            heavy-hitting hammer attacks.[1][3] The first protagonist 2B
            alternates between two weapons, the second protagonist 9S combines
            light attacks with hacking into enemies, and the final protagonist
            A2 can sacrifice health to briefly boost her attack power.[4] There
            are four classes of weapons available; short swords, long swords,
            bracers, and spears. Attacks with different weapon types can be
            charged and launched for increased damage.[1][3]
